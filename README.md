## Project Overview

This project was created based on a tutorial I followed a few years ago.
The tutorial provided a comprehensive guide on creating a web app using React and Typescript.
The goal was to learn the basic consepts of typescript language. 
I implemented the project to enhance my understanding of Typescript.

### Technologies Used

•  React: the library for web and native user interfaces. Build user interfaces out of individual 
    pieces called components written in JavaScript.
    
•  TypeScript: A free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static 
   typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript.
